    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">Trash stats:</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">Every year, Americans throw away 50 billion cans, 27 billion glass bottles and jars, and 65 million plastic and metal jar and can covers. More than 30% of our waste is packaging materials. Where does it all go? Some 85% of our garbage is sent to a dump, or landfill, although we are quickly running out of space here on Earth.</h2></div>

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">How can we use fewer natural resources?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">
      In order to solve Natural resource depletion, we can use more renewable energy.
      <br>
      <br>
      About 63 percent of our electricity comes from fossil fuels, which are natural resources that only replenish over an extremely long time.
      <br>
      <br>
      Resources like wind and sunlight, however, can also be used to generate electricity, but these resources are renewable. That means once they are used, they become available again quickly. While using fossil fuels to generate electricity burns up finite resources, using renewables does not.
      <br>
      <br>
      Renewable energy also doesnâ€™t release greenhouse gases, which are causing climate change.

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">How much isn't recycled that should be recycled?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">
      The recycling rate (including composting) was 32.1 percent in 2018, down from 34.7 percent in 2015.
    <br>
    This means that in 2018, 67.9% of all recyclable material wasn't recycled, and was just thrown away just like normal trash, and takes up needed space in the landfills.</h2></div>

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">What are the effects of effects of pollution?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">
      Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema.
      Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. 
      Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects.</h2></div>

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">How can you teach people about the environment?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">
      <ul>
        <li>Developing reliable online resources that provide quality environmental health information.</li>
        <li>Creating lesson plans that integrate our resources into the classroom and extracurricular activities.</li>
        <li>Engaging teachers by inviting collaborations and promoting our resources and activities.</li></ul></h2>

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">Why must we preserve nature?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. 
      They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. 
      They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies. 
      All in all, we cannot be healthy in an unhealthy environment. 
      It is in our best interest to preserve the Earth as best as we can.</h2></div>

    <div class="sectionDivider"><h1 class="sectionTextTopMargin">What are the 3 R's?</h1></div>
    
    <div class="sectionContentDivider"><h2 class="sectionContentText">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reduce.</b> Purchase products that require less packaging or to limit the waste you are producing.</li>
        <li><b>Reuse.</b> Use a travel mug or reusable water bottle and avoid single-use bags.</li>
        <li><b>Recycle.</b> Paper, plastic, glass, magazines, electronics, and more can be processed into new products while using fewer natural resources and less energy.</li>
      </ul>
      These 3 Rs help us understand what needs to be done in order to help us conserve our Earth.
